# Hey, I’m Andrew Longron 👋  

I’m a veteran, a former chemical plant operator, and a guy who’s never been able to sit still when there’s something worth building.  
After a decade running high-pressure operations, I jumped headfirst into entrepreneurship, marketing, and content creation — and I’ve never looked back.

I’m a values-led innovator and hands-on builder who merges technology, creativity, and ethics to create systems that work for people — not against them. As a veteran and lifelong problem-solver, I cut through hype and corporate noise to design AI, automation, and open-source solutions that solve real problems today while preparing for tomorrow’s challenges. I challenge “accepted” science with direct experimentation, blending frontier tech with natural systems to build tools that are resilient, practical, and owned by the individual, not controlled by the institution.

## What I’m All About
- I see opportunity in the problems most people ignore — and I build systems to solve them.  
- I don’t do “employees” and “bosses.” I do **partnerships**. We win together.  
- I’d rather work with three people who share my values than a hundred chasing quick money.  
- I believe in using AI, tech, and creativity to give people *real* tools that make their lives easier.  
- I’m a little neurodivergent, which means my brain doesn’t just think outside the box — it ignores the box entirely.

## My Main Gig – Coverage Creatives  
I run **[Coverage Creatives](https://yourwebsite.com)**, a marketing agency built to help insurance agencies actually stand out online.  
Here’s how we do it:
- You film the content, we do *everything else*.  
- We handle your social media, SEO, Google Ads, editing, and unified marketing strategy.  
- It’s all powered by **Coverage Content**, the platform I built to run our entire operation from one place.  

The goal?  
To make marketing feel less like a chore and more like an engine that’s always running — even when you’re not.

## The Creator Side of Me
I’m not just behind a desk.  
I’m out overlanding, fishing, testing gear, and making tutorials to help people get the most out of their adventures.  

- **TikTok:** Almost **300,000 followers** — built 100% organically, posting whatever feels real, from outdoor adventures to the occasional ridiculous idea.  
- **YouTube:** Overlanding, fishing, gear reviews, and tech how-tos (especially GoPro and camera tutorials).  
- **Instagram & Facebook:** Same vibe — less about algorithms, more about connecting with the right people.  

And yeah, I only work with brands that share my values. No exceptions.

## What Drives Me
I get the biggest rush from taking a raw idea, running it through my brain’s “what-if” filter, and building it into something that works.  
Sometimes that’s a business. Sometimes it’s a tool. Sometimes it’s a system that lets someone finally take a weekend off because their operation runs itself.

For me, success isn’t about just making money. It’s about making things that last — and making sure the people involved are proud of how we did it.
